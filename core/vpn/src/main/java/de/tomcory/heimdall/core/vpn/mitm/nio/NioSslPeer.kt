/**
 * A class that represents an SSL/TLS peer, and can be extended to create a client or a server.
 *
 *
 * It makes use of the JSSE framework, and specifically the [SSLEngine] logic, which
 * is described by Oracle as "an advanced API, not appropriate for casual use", since
 * it requires the user to implement much of the communication establishment procedure himself.
 * More information about it can be found here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#SSLEngine
 *
 *
 * [NioSslPeer] implements the handshake protocol, required to establish a connection between two peers,
 * which is common for both client and server and provides the abstract [NioSslPeer.read] and
 * [NioSslPeer.write] methods, that need to be implemented by the specific SSL/TLS peer
 * that is going to extend this class.
